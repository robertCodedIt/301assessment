# Final Exam 301 Front-End

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

This will run a suite of tests (just like on your code challenges).

## Notes

- When you see `data-<anything>="anything"`, you can ignore it. These attributes are there to make the tests work. Don't change them in any way or your tests will fail, but don't worry about them.
